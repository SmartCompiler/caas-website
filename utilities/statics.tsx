        descripiton: 'Compilation often takes a long time, especially for large projects or when identifying better optimization options. Currently, compilers are mainly installed on local machines and used as standalone software. Despite the availability of several online compilers, they do not offer an efficient all-in-one package for private account management, command line interface (CLI), code advisors, and optimization techniques. Today, the widespread usage of Software as a Service (SaaS) is ever-growing, and compilers are not an exception. In this paper, we describe a symmetric approach to compilation and how to compile code on distributed systems. Although some improvements in cloud compilers have been made, it is possible to harness the potential of the most-modern technologies and architecture patterns toward designing efficient, in-cloud compilers',
